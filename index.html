      <h4>The Explanation</h4>
      <p> 
        <br> 17
        <br> A collection of nightmares,
        <br> thoughts, and real-life 
        <br> situations I've lived 
        <br>
        <br> 17 is the number tattooed
        <br> on the right side of my head 
        <br> My own personal number
        <br> Soon to be explained in 
        <br> future interviews or instances
        <br>
        <br> By listening to this album, 
        <br> you are literally
        <br> And I cannot stress this enough,
        <br> literally entering my mind
        <br>
        <br> And if you are not willing 
        <br> to accept my emotion and
      </p>

     <div class="btn2" id="right0"> 
      <p> 
        <br> hear my words fully, 
        <br> do not listen
        <br> I do not value your money; 
        <br> I value your acceptance
        <br> and loyalty
        <br> Here is my pain and thoughts 
        <br> put into words
        <br>
        <br> I put my all into this
        <br> In the hopes that it will cure, 
        <br> or at least numb your depression
        <br>
        <br> I love you, thank you for listening
        <br> Enjoy
